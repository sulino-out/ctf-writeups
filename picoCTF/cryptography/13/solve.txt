You'll get a enciphered text:

cvpbPGS{abg_gbb_onq_bs_n_ceboyrz}

The tip (given by the chall's name and its description) is to use ROT13.
Opening dcode.fr and searching for the caesar cipher, you just need to shift each letter by 13.

After decrypting the message, you get the flag: picoCTF{not_too_bad_of_a_problem}
