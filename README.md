# CTF-Writeups

Write-ups of CTF challenges I've worked on. Most of the events I participated were in conjunction with [Ganesh](https://ganesh.icmc.usp.br/) - a cybersecurity study group from [University of Sao Paulo](https://www5.usp.br/), but some were individual, e.g SEMCOMP CTF

#### List of CTFs

* pico CTF
* why CTF 2025
* SEMCOMP CTF 2025

## How it is organized

The write-ups are organized in folders in the following pattern: `/year_ctfName/category/challengeName`, e.g `/2025_whyCTF/rev/lazycode2.0` or `ctfName/category/challengeName` in case its challenges are avaialble on the internet at any time, e.g `picoCTF/cryptography/hashcrack`
