This chall gives us the source code of the program running on 'nc verbal-sleep.picoctf.net 60565'

When you first check the program, you note that it is basically encrypting the flag with the public key (using RSA algorithm).
So, all we need to do is decrypt it by discovering the private key (p, q, d)

To solve this chall we will run a program in python which we will make ourselves, by start we just need to make sure PyCryptodome is installed by running in our terminal:

$ pip install pycryptodome

At the start of our program, we need to call the functions we will use for decrypting the ciphertext:

~ from Crypto.Util.number import long_to_bytes, inverse

Whenever you run the program, N can be divided by two, so, starting writing our program in python, we can find:

~ p = 2
~ q = N // p # '//' is necessary for taking the integer value of the division

'd' can be found by taking the modular inverse of 'e' (which is always 65573) mod Φ(n), with Φ(n) = (p-1)*(q-1).

~ d = inverse(e, (p-1)*(q-1)) # Φ(n) = (p-1)*(q-1)

After this having the private key got, we just need to decrypt de ciphertext by remembering that c^d ≡ m mod n, so:

~ flag = pow(ciphertext, d, N)
~ flag = long_to_bytes(flag).decode('utf-8')

~ print(flag)

This program is written in the 'solve.py' file and after running it, you get the flag:

picoCTF{tw0_1$_pr!m3f81fef0a}
