Entering in the website https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/56830/, you will be prompted with the question 'Where are the robots?'

Changing the URL to go to the robots.txt page, we note a weird disallow:

- Disallow: /1bb4c.html

After putting it in the URL, we get the flag:

picoCTF{ca1cu1at1ng_Mach1n3s_1bb4c}
